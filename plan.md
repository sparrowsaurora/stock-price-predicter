## What This Project Aims To Be

`Summary` :  
This project aims to give the complete data from a stock.
By using data like historical prices, signals, trends, recent preformance, current news, etc.  
We analyse and make predictions using a neural network which gives estimates of a stocks growth or fall over a 5 business day period.  
This data is then displayed in a Graph and text information, and tested via paper trading

## The Plan

`Summary` :

1. Create basic stock class.
2. Start using api to pull data.
3. Colate all data into something that can be analysed by machine and humans
4. Initialyse a neural network for analysis of data which returns some scores.
5. Use scores to make predictions of price and longevity of a stock, and an idea for it's future trajectory.
6. Show data in a meaningful way (terminal + webapi)
7. test using paper trading bot using these signals
